In this lecture, we'll discuss the method of CART,
and a related method called random forests.
We will then see if these methods can actually
outperform experts in predicting the outcome of Supreme Court
cases.

To control splits, use the minbucket parameter,
for the minimum number of observations
in each bucket or subset.
The smaller minbucket is, the more splits will be generated.

Threshold of 0.5 corresponds to picking most frequent 
outcome
