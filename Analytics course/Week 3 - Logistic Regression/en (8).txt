Let us examine what we learned in this lecture.
We built an expert-trained model by a physician
that can accurately identify diabetic patients receiving
low quality care.
We have observed that the out of sample accuracy of the model
was 78%.
But most importantly, the model identifies most patients
receiving poor care, which is the major objective
in the study.

Logistic regression models provide
probabilities of somebody receiving poor quality care.
These probabilities can be used to prioritize patients
for intervention, a particularly useful outcome from the study.
While the accuracy is reasonably high, 78%,
it can be, of course, further improved.
In that respect, I expect that electronic medical records, not
only claims, could be used in the future
to enhance the predictive capability of such models.
So a model like the one we built can
be used to analyze literally millions of records.
Whereas a human can only accurately analyze rather small
amounts of information.
So clearly such a model allows significantly larger
scalability.

Of course models do not replace expert judgement.
However, models provide a way to translate expert judgement
to a reproducible, testable prediction methodology that
has significantly higher scalability, as we discussed.
And of course experts can continuously improve and refine
the model, as we have seen in this lecture.

Finally, and quite importantly, models
can integrate assessments of multiple experts
into one final, unbiased, and unemotional prediction.

And such methods of combining assessments and combining
models is a tool that we will use
later in the class on multiple occasions
as a way of enhancing and improving quantitative models.
